# KaggleProject_HotelBookingDemand

## Dataset
The dataset is used in the project is Hotel Booking Demand  https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand. This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.
## Objective
The Objective of this project is to predict whether the hotel reservation will be cancelled. The response value is binary classification value composed of 0 and 1. 0 represents the hotel booking is not cancelled, 1 represents the hotel booking is cancelled.
The audiences of the project are the hotels that want to allocate resources reasonably according to the cancellation rate of bookings during peak seasons, or the hotels that want to find out which factors cause booking cancelation. They can make improvements to these factors.
## Data Mining Approaches
The data mining approaches will be used in the project: penalized logistic regression (ridge regression) model and the random forest model. There are four reasons for selecting these two methods: 1. The response variable is a categorical variable. 2. There are categorical and numerical predictors variable.  3. The two methods help avoid overfitting. 4. The most influential predictor in the model can be found.
